Visual Kinship Recognition with Deep Learning
Face recognition technology has been greatly promoted in recent years due to the large expansion of image sharing on social networks. Kinship recognition from facial images is an interesting and challenging problem in face analysis. In this paper, we proposed a new method using deep learning for kinship recognition based on the largest database for visual kinship recognition, Families In the Wild (FIW). Given each pair of face images, we aim to determine the kinship relation between them. Firstly, we extract multiple features of each image using a pretrained computer vision model called Residual Network. Then, we calculate the distance of each features between the two images. We define a deep learning classification model using distances and labels as train set in order to predict which kinship relation this pair of face images belong to. Finally, we evaluate and analyze the model performance on kinship recognition.
